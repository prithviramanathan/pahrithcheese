The flavour graph varies according to its age, ranging from buttery when it is young and bitter when it is mature. During maturing, the cheese turns into deliciously runny and almost liquidy paste. A fully matured La Serena has a creamy consistency that can be scooped out after cutting out the circular lid. The intense bitter yet pleasant flavour tastes best with bread or toast."},

The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content.

Her dairy, Tiviski, located in the capital of West African Mauritania makes this cheese with the help of milk collected from the local camel herds. Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield.\r\nBy using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine.\r\nSince the Mauritanians don&amp;rsquo;t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores.\r\nCaravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow&amp;rsquo;s, buffalo&amp;rsquo;s, sheep&amp;rsquo;s or goat&amp;rsquo;s cheese. In fact, it has 3 times more nutrients than cow&amp;rsquo;s milk."},

As the cheese matures it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white bloomy rind that is typical to Camenbert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is bloomy white caused by a white fungus, called penicillium candidum.

It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its tough texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals.\r\nCaerphilly is made from unpasteurised cows' milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days.

Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of a cheddar cheese can vary.\r\nCheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow&amp;rsquo;s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its aging time.\r\nIn Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize winning cheddar maker in all Canada, is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada include cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.\r\nMild and Medium Cheddars are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelets, sandwiches and as garnish.

The cheese is produced only by a few farmsteads or cheese retailers and is sold locally.\r\nThe cheese comes in the shape of a truncated cylinder called &quot;bonde&quot;, approximately 6 cm in height and 5 to 6 cm in diameter. After 10 days of the maturing process, Chabichou contains a minimum 45% fat and comes coated with a thin layer of grey-blue islets. If the cheese is made by a farmstead, it is naturally allowed to develop the mould, whereas Penicillium is inserted into the cheese if made by a dairy. The cheese is sold at a minimum maturing age of 2 weeks but may be matured for five to six weeks to acquire an intense aroma and flavour.\r\nUpon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. Cut the cheese and it reveals a firm, creamy &amp;ldquo;bright white&amp;rdquo; interior but not before unwinding a thin buttery layer. Even though it smells typically &amp;ldquo;goaty&amp;rdquo;, the flavours are sweet with a bit of salty and tangy edge at the end. As the cheese ages, it becomes savoury,&amp;nbsp;piquant and nutty.

While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\r\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.\r\nDouble Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards."},

Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, Pecorino Romano is one of the most ancient types of cheese as well as the most famous outside of Italy. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on how much they have aged.\r\nAs the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to the Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella have mentioned about the cheese &amp;amp; its production technique, in their works. Even today, the cheese is made using only traditional methods in the unique areas of origin. Dry-salted by hand, the wheels get a salting numerous times, to deliver a fabulous taste. Its lengthy aging time from eight to 12 months results in a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for eight months or longer.\r\n\r\nPecorino Romano is one of most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheeses. Because of the hard texture and sharp &amp;amp; salty flavour, Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, breads and baking casseroles. Although, the use of the cheese is limited because of its extreme saltiness. Pair it with a glass of big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer."},

Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called &amp;lsquo;white cheese&amp;rsquo;.\r\nTo create traditional feta, 30 percent of goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat and cow&amp;rsquo;s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, full flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, cultures all have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of feta.\r\nOn the whole, Feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age which can be extremely creamy, or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavour of Feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel."},

Cheese makers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some of the producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese.\r\nBanon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft &amp;amp; sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.&amp;nbsp; The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour.\r\nThe local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar and the cheese left to ferment, with just the sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes.\r\nBanon goes well with crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine."},

There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda&amp;rsquo;s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings.\r\nIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.&amp;nbsp; To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces.\r\nYoung Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. There are only four cheesemakers in Gloucestershire who make Single Gloucester. It is matured for a less amount of time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\r\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester."},

At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. It pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO&amp;nbsp;Idiazabal smoked&amp;nbsp;cheese&amp;nbsp;has won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared as one of the world's 62 best cheeses. It is also available in natural flavour.&amp;nbsp;"},

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.\r\nAged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. It is shaped into a wheel that can be effectively sliced into wedged for consumption. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.\r\n\r\nThe longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda such as a five-year aged cheese develops such a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat it alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to its caramel and robust flavour.\r\nGouda cheese as a hard cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when it is paired with some white wines and any fruity wine."},

It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.\r\nThe cheese is produced from cow's full-fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and&amp;nbsp;river Nal&amp;oacute;n in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\r\nThe cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the aging period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's miter or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atronc&amp;aacute;u' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega&amp;rsquo;L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted as a &quot;tapa&quot; or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega&amp;rsquo;L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually moldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\r\nThough this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\r\nAfuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\r\nThe name 'Afuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu' is derived from the &quot;bable&quot; Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes&amp;nbsp; the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom&amp;nbsp;&amp;lsquo;drowning the rooster&amp;rsquo; refering to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster."},

This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.\r\nThe milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.\r\nThis traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.\r\nToday Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12&amp;ndash;25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9&amp;ndash;25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).\r\nVacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy&amp;rsquo;s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well."}
