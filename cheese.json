Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987.&amp;nbsp;In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. It pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO&amp;nbsp;Idiazabal smoked&amp;nbsp;cheese&amp;nbsp;has won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared as one of the world's 62 best cheeses. It is also available in natural flavour.&amp;nbsp;"},

Some of the producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese.\r\nBanon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft &amp;amp; sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.&amp;nbsp; The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour.\r\nThe local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie.

This cheese is known as &quot;the crumblies&quot;.\r\nThe recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired from other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its tough texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals.\r\nCaerphilly is made from unpasteurised cows' milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a harder texture and stronger taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel-shape with ivory-white rind dusted with fine flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and gray moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian depending upon the brand.\r\nA basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It is normally grated or melted onto dishes."},

It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. There are only four cheesemakers in Gloucestershire who make Single Gloucester. It is matured for a less amount of time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours.

The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts.

It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\r\nThe cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the aging period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's miter or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atronc&amp;aacute;u' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega&amp;rsquo;L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted as a &quot;tapa&quot; or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega&amp;rsquo;L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually moldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\r\nThough this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\r\nAfuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\r\nThe name 'Afuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu' is derived from the &quot;bable&quot; Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes&amp;nbsp; the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega&amp;rsquo;l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom&amp;nbsp;&amp;lsquo;drowning the rooster&amp;rsquo; refering to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster."},

This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.\r\nThe milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.\r\nThis traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.\r\nToday Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12&amp;ndash;25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9&amp;ndash;25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).\r\nVacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy&amp;rsquo;s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well."},
